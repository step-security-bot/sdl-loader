* SDL 1.2

SDL 1.2 which was last updated 2013 had been used to graphic expression is Common Lisp.
The Common Lisp binding for SDL 1.2 were provied by the lispbuilder package.
Many of the smaller effort were not tested on Windows.

As an example [[https://github.com/sebity/the-invaders]] is a version of the space invaders game.
I forked this code and attempted to get the game running.

The code [[https://github.com/privet-kitty/dufy]] has an example which could run with SDL 1.2.

* SDL 2

The windows support for SDL 2 has a spotted history.
When I attemped to update the-invaders for SDL 2, I stopped because of the difficulty with the lisp interface code on Windows.


* First attempt

- Provide a location for the last binary release of SDL 1.2
- Attempt to run the-invaders.
- Go through the lisp-builders examples for sdl, sdl_image, sdl_mixer and sdl_ttf
