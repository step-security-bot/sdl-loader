This is a directory of all the various SDL dll-files that represent an entire SDL release.
I used the last released versions of SDL 1.2 zipped releases.
I downloaded the zips, unzipping the contents into a single combined directory.
Two of the readme files had the same name. zlib1 was present twice.

The pathname of the combined directory is set to the ubiquitous value for :sdl-last.
