* What am I testing?

**  the-invaders
My game and the root and origin of my SDL 1.2 quest.

** lispbuilder examples
When debugging other approaches to find the correct libraries I attempted to load and run lispbuilder sdl examples, on the assumption that the examples worked.

- lispbuilder-sdl-image-examples
- lispbuilder-sdl-mixer-examples
- lispbuilder-sdl-ttf-examples

* lispbuilder-sdl-examples
The metaballs example failed for me.
fireworks works as does mandlebrot.

* duft/examples

This is not a game but a color mapping display.
