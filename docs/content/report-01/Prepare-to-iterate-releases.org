* Configure the experimental pathname.

The experimental pathname stuffer needs to have an easily changeable path.
I have used the [[https://github.com/Shinmera/ubiquitous][ubiquitous]] system to configure other pathname options in the past, so I use it again.

#+begin_src lisp
  (ql:quickload 'ubiquitous)
  (setf (ubiquitous:value :sdl-last) #P"your-pathname")
#+end_src

You will set this value to the pathname of the combined directory once the example distribution is prepared.
